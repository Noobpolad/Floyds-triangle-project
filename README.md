# Floyds-triangle-project
Floyd's triangle lists the natural numbers in a right triangle aligned to the left where:
- the first row is 1
- successive rows start towards the left with the next number followed by successive naturals listing one more number than the line above.
The first few lines of a Floyd triangle (n=5) looks like this:

 
 1
 
 2  3
 
 4  5  6
 
 7  8  9 10

11 12 13 14 15
